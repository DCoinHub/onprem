> A tool for running large language models on-premises using non-public
> data

**OnPrem** is a simple Python package that makes it easier to run large
language models (LLMs) on non-public or sensitive data and on machines
with no internet connectivity (e.g., behind corporate firewalls).
Inspired by the [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT)
GitHub repo and Simon Willison’s [LLM](https://pypi.org/project/llm/)
command-line utility, **OnPrem** is designed to help integrate local
LLMs into practical applications.

## Install

``` sh
pip install onprem
```

For GPU support, see additional instructions below.

## How to use

### Setup

``` python
import os.path
from onprem import LLM

url = 'https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Wizard-Vicuna-7B-Uncensored-GGML/resolve/main/Wizard-Vicuna-7B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin'

llm = LLM(model_name=os.path.basename(url))
llm.download_model(url, ssl_verify=True ) # set to False if corporate firewall gives you problems
```

    There is already a file Wizard-Vicuna-7B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin in /home/amaiya/onprem_data.
     Do you want to still download it? (Y/n) Y

### Send Prompts to the LLM to Solve Problems

This is an example of few-shot prompting, where we provide an example of
what we want the LLM to do.

``` python
prompt = """Extract the names of people in the supplied sentences. Here is an example:
Sentence: James Gandolfini and Paul Newman were great actors.
People:
James Gandolfini, Paul Newman
Sentence:
I like Cillian Murphy's acting. Florence Pugh is great, too.
People:"""

saved_output = llm.prompt(prompt)
```


    Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh

### Talk to Your Documents

Answers are generated from the content of your documents.

#### Step 1: Download Some Documents to a Folder

``` python
import os
if not os.path.exists: os.mkdir('/tmp/sample_data')
!wget --user-agent="Mozilla" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10703.pdf -O /tmp/sample_data/ktrain_paper.pdf -q
```

#### Step 2: Ingest the Documents into a Vector Database

``` python
llm.ingest('/tmp/sample_data')
```

    Appending to existing vectorstore at /home/amaiya/onprem_data/vectordb
    Loading documents from /tmp/sample_data
    Loaded 9 new documents from /tmp/sample_data
    Split into 57 chunks of text (max. 500 tokens each)
    Creating embeddings. May take some minutes...
    Ingestion complete! You can now query your documents using the prompt method

    Loading new documents: 100%|██████████████████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  7.74it/s]

#### Step 3: Answer Questions About the Documents

``` python
question = """What is ktrain?"""
answer, docs = llm.ask(question)
print('References:')
for i, document in enumerate(docs):
    print(f"\n{i+1}.> " + document.metadata["source"] + ":")
    print(document.page_content)
```

     Ktrain is an open-source machine learning (ML) toolbox that focuses on enabling automation in the ML workow, rather than trying to entirely replace human engineers with algorithms. Its goal is to provide a flexible and user-friendly way for researchers and practitioners to perform ML tasks such as data preparation, model selection, training, and evaluation, while also allowing for customization and experimentation. Overall, ktrain seeks to augment and complement human engineers rather than attempting to entirely replace them.References:

    rather than attempting to entirely replace them. In doing so, the strengths of both are
    better exploited. Following inspiration from a blog post1 by Rachel Thomas of fast.ai

### Speeding Up Inference Using a GPU

The above example employed the use of a CPU.  
If you have a GPU (even an older one with less VRAM), you can speed up
responses.

#### Step 1: Install `llama-cpp-python` with CUDABLAS support

``` shell
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall llama-cpp-python==0.1.69 --no-cache-dir
```

It is important to use the specific version shown above due to library
incompatibilities.

#### Step 2: Use the `n_gpu_layers` argument with [`LLM`](https://amaiya.github.io/onprem/core.html#llm)

llm = LLM(model_name=os.path.basename(url), n_gpu_layers=128)

With the steps above, calls to methods like `llm.prompt` will offload
computation to your GPU and speed up responses from the LLM.
